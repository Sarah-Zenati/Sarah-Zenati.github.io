I am postdoc at the [INRIA Mind](https://team.inria.fr/mind/) and [INRIA Soda](https://team.inria.fr/soda/) teams working with [Bertrand Thirion](https://pages.saclay.inria.fr/bertrand.thirion/), [Judith Abecassis](https://judithabk6.github.io/) and [Julie Josse](https://juliejosse.com/) at the [INRIA PreMedical](https://team.inria.fr/premedical/) team.

My thesis manuscript was on [Efficient methods in counterfactual policy learning and sequential decision making]({{site.baseurl}}{% link phd_manuscript.pdf %}).

I did my PhD at [INRIA Thoth](https://team.inria.fr/thoth/) under the supervision of [Julien Mairal](https://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/mairal/) and [Pierre Gaillard](http://pierre.gaillard.me/) in collaboration with the causal inference research group at the [Criteo AI Lab](https://ailab.criteo.com/research-team/). My research interests lie in the interface of counterfactual reasoning and online learning algorithms.

Prior to that, I received a M.Eng. degree in applied mathematics and computer science from [CentraleSupelec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/) as well as the [MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/) M.Sc. degree from [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/).

Previously, I also worked at the [Institute for Infocomm Research](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r) under the supervision of [Chuan-Sheng Foo](http://ai.stanford.edu/~csfoo/) and [Vijay Chandrasekhar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KUt4JCAAAAAJ&hl=en).

You can find my CV [here]({{site.baseurl}}{% link CV_Houssam_Zenati.pdf %}).

I also like hiking, traveling and learning Japanese, [as you may see here](./another-page.html).
