I am a third-year undergraduate student in [MIASHS (Mathematics and Computer Science Applied to Social Sciences)](https://licence.math.univ-paris-diderot.fr/formations/miashs/) at the [University of Paris Cité](https://u-paris.fr). 
 

In addition to my studies, I enjoy self-learning coding, implementing algorithms and discovering insights from data, all of which I put on my [Github](https://github.com/Sarah-Zenati) page. 

Currently, I am working on a project alongside the PhD candidate [Waffa Nekka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/waffane/) in psychosociology regarding the impact of higher education trajectories on identity construction.
Furthermore, I am a member of [Different Leaders](https://www.different-leaders.com), a collective of young individuals committed to equal access to education, with diverse and inspiring success stories. 

Previously, I completed a civic service at [Article1](https://article-1.eu), during which I carried out numerous missions and projects to support young students in pursuing their studies. In particular, I had the opportunity to work alongside an education sociologist and met the former French President François Hollande during a presentation by the Different Leaders collective.

In my free time, I enjoy engaging in photography, particularly landscape and nature sites, [as you may see here](./another-page.html).

Moreover, I also have a deep appreciation for literature, especially Russian novels by authors such as Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, [as you may see here](./another-page2.html).
